# PyCompressor
Compresses mp3 files in a folder to a rar file.

1. Set Up the Paths: Replace mp3_folder and output_rar with the paths you want to use for the folder containing .mp3 files and where the .rar archive should be saved.

2. Ensure WinRAR: Make sure WinRAR is installed, and if itâ€™s not in your PATH, replace WinRAR in the command list with the full path to WinRAR.exe.

3. Run the Script: Once configured, the script will compress all .mp3 files in the specified folder into a .rar file.
